Differences between MMU7 and DOT version
----------------------------------------

L0.asm
------
In general, rst $10 is called widh interrupt disabled 
(?EMIT)     calling $03B6, DOT version must use RST $18 but don't use TSTACK.
CURS        calling $1601, DOT version must use RST $18 and dare to use TSTACK.
SELECT      idem c.s.


L2.asm
------
Startup from Basic in DOT version has to initialize more things:
    0. save H'L' for later
    1. accepts one parameter from Basic and make it available to AUTOEXEC
    2. save hw-register status Speed, MMU2-MMU7, and current Layer 
    3. reserve twelve 8k pages from $1D to $28, (8 HEAP, 3 MAIN, 1 BACKUP)
    4. backup MMU2 content, to be restored when exiting to Basic
    5. change current directory to C:/tools/vForth/ 
    6. setup MMU pages for Forth
    7. get current handle and load to $E000 the rest of vocabulary
    8. set layer 1,2
    9. pre-set four main Z80 register, enable interrupt and start Forth.     
        SP Calculator Stack Pointer 
        IX Inner Interpreter Pointer
        DE Return Stack Pointer     
        BC Instruction Pointer      
       
Closedown restores original status and frees RAM pages.

WARM        DOT does not execute SPLASH
        


L3.asm
------
CLS         call $0DAF is performed via rst $18 
AUTOEXEC    normal version executes 11 LOAD while 
            but DOT version includes filename passed as parameter from Basic 
            or default filename "c:/tools/vforth/lib/autoexec.f"


next-opt1.asm
-------------
BLK-INIT    in case of error, DOT version exit to Basic with error.
            while MMU version raise ERROR and stays in Forth
BLK-FH      DOT versione, moved at end of source L3.asm


next-opt0.asm
-------------
F_CLOSE
F_SYNC
F_GETPOS    DOT version has to DIsable interrupt  

F_SEEK
F_READ
F_WRITE
F_OPEN
F_OPENDIR
F_READDIR   DOT version has to DIsable interrupt and pass HL to IX.
