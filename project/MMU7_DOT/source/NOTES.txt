Differences between MMU7 and DOT version
----------------------------------------

L0.asm
------
EMITC       MMU7 version pokes SCR_CT to have unlimited scroll
CR          DOT version emit chr$(26)+chr$(0) to have unlimited scroll
(?EMIT)     calling $03B6, DOT version must use RST $18 but don't use TSTACK.
CURS        calling $1601, DOT version must use RST $18 and dare to use TSTACK.
SELECT      idem c.s.


L2.asm
------
Startup from Basic in DOT version has to initialize more things:
    0. store at $3FFC H'L' and return-address to Basic
    1. accepts one parameter from Basic and make it available to AUTOEXEC
    2. save hw-register status Speed, MMU2-MMU7, and current Layer 
    3. reserve twelve 8k pages from $1D to $28, (8 HEAP, 3 MAIN, 1 BACKUP)
    4. backup MMU2 content, to be restored when exiting to Basic
    5. set layer 1,2
    6. change current directory to C:/tools/vForth/ and setup MMU for Forth.
    7. get current handle and load to $E000 the rest of vocabulary
    8. pre-set four main Z80 register 
        SP Calculator Stack Pointer 
        IX Inner Interpreter Pointer
        DE Return Stack Pointer     
        BC Instruction Pointer      
    9. enable interrupt and start Forth.    
Closedown restores original status and frees RAM pages.

WARM        DOT does not execute SPLASH
        


L3.asm
------
AUTOEXEC    MMU7 executes 11 LOAD whiile 
            DOT  includes filename passed as parameter from Basic or 
            defaulted with "c:/tools/vforth/lib/autoexec.f"


next-opt1.asm
-------------
BLK-INIT    in case of error, DOT version exit to Basic with error.
            while MMU version raise ERROR and stays in Forth
BLK-FH      DOT versione, moved at end of source L3.asm


next-opt1.asm
-------------
F_SEEK
F_CLOSE
F_SYNC
F_GETPOS    DOT version has to DIsable interrupt 

F_READ
F_WRITE
F_OPEN
F_OPENDIR
F_READDIR   DOT version has to DIsable interrupt and pass HL to IX.
