Differences between v1.7 and 1.8
----------------------------------------

------
L0.asm
------

2!      final part is equal to ! so save a 4 bytes (Store_end:)
AND OR XOR restored slower version, these few bytes aren't worth this change ?
ENCLOSE is optimized to save space on exiting [push de...]

    (COMPARE) is optimized to save space on common exit [push hl...]
    (EMITC) replaces EMITC that can be vectored
    (CLS)   replaces CLS that can be vectored
    CR      is made colon definition to be routed via EMIT
    (?EMIT) modified to allow UDG
    CURS    is made colon definitio to be able to vector it later
    (?DO)   should we save 2 bytes?
    CMOVE>  should we save 2 bytes?
    UM/MOD  exits through UM* ending part (save 3 bytes)
    

------
L1.asm
------

<BUILDS now is the same as CREATE, but kept for backward compatibility.

DOES>   now compiles a "_DOES>_" followed by a "call" op-code to Enter i.e. same as ":"
        _DOES>_  replaces what DOES> did in previous version.

2FIND   needs one  CELL+  less because of how new FORTH VOCABULARY is built


    EMITC   is moved here from L0.asm and calls (EMITC)
    CR      is moved here from L0.asm and calls EMIT
    CURS    is moved here from L0.asm -- this is a translation from the original CODE


------
L2.asm
------

FORTH   doesn't have the indirect pointer to the DOES> part of VOCABULARY
        For the same reason 2FIND has one  CELL+  less.

VOCABULARY begins with CREATE instead of <BUILDS and ends with _DOES>_ instead of DOES>
        _DOES>_ is followed by a "call" op-code to Enter i.e. same as ":"

WARM    doesn't SPLASH anymore.

------
L3.asm
------

MARKER  begins with CREATE instead of <BUILDS and ends with _DOES>_ instead of DOES>
        _DOES>_ is followed by a "call" op-code to Enter i.e. same as ":"

CLS     is made colon definition and calls (CLS)
