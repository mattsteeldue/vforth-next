Differences between v1.7 and 1.8
----------------------------------------

L0.asm
------

2!      final part is equal to ! so save a few bytes (Store_end:)


L1.asm
------

2FIND   needs one  CELL+  less because of how new FORTH VOCABULARY is built

DOES>   now compiles a "_DOES>_" followed by a "call" op-code to Enter i.e. same as ":"
        _DOES>_  replaces what DOES> did in previous version.

<BUILDS now is the same as CREATE, but kept for backward compatibility.


L2.asm
------

FORTH   doesn't have the indirect pointer to the DOES> part of VOCABULARY
        For the same reason 2FIND has one  CELL+  less.

VOCABULARY begins with CREATE instead of <BUILDS and ends with _DOES>_ instead of DOES>
        _DOES>_ is followed by a "call" op-code to Enter i.e. same as ":"


L3.asm
------

MARKER  begins with CREATE instead of <BUILDS and ends with _DOES>_ instead of DOES>
        _DOES>_ is followed by a "call" op-code to Enter i.e. same as ":"
